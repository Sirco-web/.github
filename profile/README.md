# Sirco Web

Welcome to Sirco Web — a private organization focused on building high-quality custom web products. We create and maintain custom websites, game sites, statistics platforms, forums, and related web services. Nothing else.

Organization: https://github.com/Sirco-web

IMPORTANT: This is a private organization. Access to repositories, code, and internal resources is restricted and governed by our policies and license terms.

---

## What we build

- Custom websites  
- Game sites  
- Statistics platforms and dashboards  
- Forums and community platforms  
- Integrations directly related to the above

Our scope is intentionally narrow and focused on the web products listed above.

## Repository usage policy — DO NOT FORK OUR REPOSITORIES

DO NOT FORK OUR REPOSITORIES. Our repositories are private and access-controlled. Do not copy, clone, mirror, fork, or redistribute repository contents without express written permission.

If you require access, integration, or a commercial license for any Sirco Web product, contact our legal or business teams (see contacts below). Unauthorized use, distribution, or attempted circumvention of access controls is a breach of policy and may result in legal action.

---

## Business & partnerships

We engage in commercial collaborations, licensed integrations, and paid development work aligned with our core offerings (custom websites, game sites, statistics platforms, forums). For partnership inquiries, proposals, or to discuss a paid engagement, contact our business team at hello@sirco-web.com and include scope, timeline, and budget expectations.

## Organization statistics (public data only / private org)

Below are the GitHub-stat badges for the organization (public data only). Because Sirco Web is a private organization, these services may show errors or "can't fetch" for private-repo metrics. If the badges do not render (or show "can't fetch"), it's because the badge services cannot access private repository data. We include them here per request; to produce private stats reliably, use an authorized internal workflow (see note below).

Note: If your organization has no public repositories or limited public activity, the images above may fail to fetch or show empty data. To generate private, authorized statistics that include private repositories, consider a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow that uses an organization-scoped token to aggregate metrics and render badges or internal dashboards.
